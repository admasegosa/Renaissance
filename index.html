            Transport is a fundamental sector for the economy of both the European Union (EU) and Spain. At the EU level, it represents 9% of the total added value of the economy, 9% of total employment, and 17.2% of exports of services. However, transport also generates negative social effects (accidents, air pollution, etc.) whose external costs account for 4% of EU GDP. For this reason, the AI4Transport project proposes to carry out fundamental and experimental research in the area of Artificial Intelligence to tackle Challenge 4 of the current National Plan for Scientific and Technical Research and Innovation in "Sustainable, Intelligent, Connected, and Integrated Transport".
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
            This project focuses on two of the sectors in which the main transport problems in the EU are concentrated: urban mobility (congestion, impact on climate change, air pollution, and safety) and freight transport (low efficiency and response to the "on-demand" economy).
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The motivation of the AI4Transport project is based on the need to address these challenges and, to this end, it sets as a general objective the development of new Artificial Intelligence techniques to leverage the current high availability of transport data (from both conventional and non-conventional data sources) and the potential offered by emerging mobility solutions (electric vehicles, connected and autonomous vehicles, micro-mobility, etc.) to contribute to the solution of the main problems faced by urban mobility and freight transport.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            The principal investigator of this project participated in the research team of previous projects such as OptSIs, ASCETAS, ESPHIA from the National R&D&I Plan, and TIMON and PostLowCIT from the European Horizon2020 programme.

							To achieve the proposed objective, the research posed in AI4Transport focuses on the following areas, because of their impact on the aforementioned challenges of urban mobility and freight transport:
						</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
							<li>New traffic prediction methods that improve current systems by reducing the need for expert knowledge for the generation of prediction models and by extending their spatial and temporal scope. To this end, the aim is to develop new Automatic Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.</li>
							<li>New tools for Travel Behaviour Analysis that contribute to a better understanding of how citizens use and will use emerging modes of mobility. For this purpose, the design of Machine Learning and Data Fusion techniques capable of handling multiple heterogeneous data sources simultaneously is proposed.</li>
							<li>New models and optimization algorithms that contribute to a more collaborative and synchromodal logistics. More specifically, the aim is first to create richer versions of the Vehicle Routing Problem that consider collaboration between agents and that model the use and particularities of emerging mobility modes, and optimization methods based on hybrid metaheuristics capable of addressing the complexity of these models.</li>
